"""The rail's two editors: which apps it lists, and which modules each app offers.

The desk draws both in Frappe's own arrangement editor (`frappe.ui.ArrangementEditor`,
the one behind Manage Dock and Edit Sidebar) -- see `js/arrange.js`. This is what they
read and write. Everything is stored where it already was, on `Desk App`
records, so the form and the editors are two ways into the same data:

- Manage Desk Apps orders and hides apps (`rail_after` and `hidden`), sets how each shows
  on the Apps screen (`apps_screen`, previewed with the tiles it would draw), and adds
  new ones: a Desk App of its own, with a title and an icon, which then needs modules
  before the rail shows it.
- Manage Modules orders, adds and takes modules off one app's list, with
  Category and Spacer rows between them: the record's modules table. It can also
  make a new module there and then: a custom Module Def of the site's own, made on
  save, so a new app can be filled without leaving the editor. Taking one of an
  installed app's own modules off its list switches the record to Replace, which is
  what sends a module to Other; with none taken off it stays in Add, so a module the
  app gains later still turns up.

Only the site's arrangement is edited ("For everyone"). There is no per-user layer:
Desk Apps are site records.

The rail order is the whole rail's, whichever editor wrote. Every app sits at its
default place unless its record anchors it after another (see `desk_apps`), so
a save writes an anchor only onto the apps that left the default order, and a record
is made only for an app that needs one to hold a position or to be hidden. A record
an editor made that no longer holds anything (`_is_placeholder`) is deleted again.
