"""Frappe's Apps screen, arranged from the Desk Apps.

Frappe 16.50's Apps screen (`/desk`, with Desktop Settings on "Apps") draws one tile per
entry in `frappe.boot.app_data` that is `on_apps_screen`, ordered by `sequence_id`, and
sends each to its landing route: the entry's `app_route`, else the first row of its
`dock`, else its first module (`Sidebar.app_landing_route`). So the screen is arranged
here, in the boot, and Frappe draws it -- nothing in the browser is patched.

Each app on the rail, in rail order, as its Desk App's Apps Screen setting says:

- Default (and every app with no record): what Frappe would do. An installed app gets
  its own tile when it asks for one (`add_to_apps_screen`, and not mounted on another
  app), and none otherwise -- Telephony and Print Designer do not ask. Other has no
  tile, since Frappe has no such app. An app of the site's own gets one.
- One Icon: its own tile, under its rail title and logo, whether or not the app asks.
- Icon per Module: a tile for each of its modules, in its order -- and one for its
  frontend, first, if it has one -- each opening that module. A module's picture is its
  row's Apps Screen Image, else its own icon -- the one its sidebar header and the Dock
  draw -- on a tile in its app's colour (`module_tiles`), else the letter Frappe draws.
  Not the artwork some apps ship under `public/icons/desktop_icons/`: that was drawn for
  the desktop before 16.50, for workspaces rather than modules, and matching it to a
  module by file name is guesswork.
- App and Module Icons: the app's own tile, then its module tiles, as above. The frontend
  gets no tile of its own when the app's tile already opens it.
- Hidden: no tile; it stays on the rail.

An app taken off the rail is off the Apps screen too, and every other entry is turned off.

A tile that leads to `/app/...`, the desk's address before 16.50, is pointed at the same page
under `/desk/...`. Frappe's own `app_home` is still `/app/build`: the desk does not treat that
as its own link, so the browser loads it from the server, which redirects it
(`website_redirects`) and reloads the whole page. The rewrite is the redirect's own, done
before the click, so the tile opens in place like every other.

A module tile is an `app_data` entry of its own, named `opendesk-module:<shell>`, whose
`dock` is that one module: Frappe's landing ladder then opens the module the way a rail
tile would. Such entries are only ever on the Apps screen; the module still belongs to
its rail app everywhere else.

Off unless Open Desk Settings' "Override Desktop Icons" is ticked, and off too
while Desktop Settings' Desktop Page is "Desktop Icons": that is Frappe's older icon grid,
drawn from Desktop Icon records with each user's own arrangement, which Frappe is retiring
(`frappe/desk/RETIRING.md`). A site that chose it gets it as Frappe draws it.
